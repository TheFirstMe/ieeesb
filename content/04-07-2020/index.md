An online spectrum talk on the topic “Biosensors May Hold The Key To Mass Corona Virus Testing” was conducted on the 4th of July 2020. The talk was given by Jijina of S3 EEE at 7pm in Google Meet platform.
Biosensors used for viral RNA, antibody, or antigen detection all rely on semiconductor circuitry coated in a biological material that will attract and bind with the biological material of interest in a sample fluid. Jijina explained how such an approach could reduce false results and provide additional information about a patient’s health.
The talk ended with a Q&A session in which Jijina entertained lots of questions from the audience.
