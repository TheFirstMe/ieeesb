As a part of WIE WEEK, WIE Affinity group of IEEE SB GCEK conducted ‘PEN IT DOWN’, a story writing competition from 11th March to 17th March 2021. Topic chosen for the competition was the ‘Being an Engineer, you may all know about the techie woman, social worker, author Sudha Murthy. She was the only woman in the batch of 150 engineering students. You can guess the difficulties and challenges she had faced during her academic years being the only girl within the group. Illustrate challenges she faced during her studies with your creativity and imagination. Let’s get inspired by such a woman through your words’. Competition was exclusively for the IEEE members. Around 6 participants submitted the story. From the submissions, Neha Baju (Vidya Academy of Science & Technology) bagged the first place and Anagha K Sasidharan (GCE Kannur) bagged second place. Event got welcoming feedback from participants in terms of its organization and relevance.
