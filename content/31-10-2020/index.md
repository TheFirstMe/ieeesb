An online spectrum talk on the topic “Pandemic vs Privacy” was conducted on the 31st of October 2020. The talk was given by Aparna Rajeev of S3 CSE at 7pm in Google Meet platform.
Aparna explained with great detail about how IoT makes things invisible which is both a boon and a bane. She also explained on how more sensors on more people means the IoT becomes a visible web of human connections that we can use to, say, track down a virus.
The talk ended with a Q&A session in which Aparna entertained lots of questions from the audience.
