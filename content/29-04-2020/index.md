Power Electronics Chapter (PELS) of IEEE SB GCEK conducted a webinar on electric vehicles as a part of COMET, which is an SBC Level initiative by IEEE IA/IE/PELS Jt Chapter Kerala. The webinar was conducted in Google Meet and was handled by Abhinav R who is an active volunteer of IEEE SB NSSCE. The webinar mainly focused on the common doubts that arises when you think of an electric car like the efficiency of electric cars, how much will it cost to charge, how long will the battery last etc. The webinar was really interesting and huge participation of students was also seen. Almost all the doubts were cleared by the speaker and it ended in a good note.
