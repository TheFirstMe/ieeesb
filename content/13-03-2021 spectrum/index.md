An online spectrum talk on the topic “How AI Conquered Protein Folding” was conducted on the 13th of March, 2021. The talk was given by Haritha M E of S3 EEE at 5.30 pm in the Google Meet Platform. Over 41 members of our SB participated.

Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is an overarching term used to describe the use of machine-learning algorithms and software,or artificial intelligence(AI), to mimic human cognition in the analysis,presentation,and comprehension of complex medical and health care data. Haritha, in this talk, explained how a system can accurately predict the structure of proteins which expedite the advancement of research areas, where it can identify the disease even before evident symptoms appear.

The talk ended with a Q&A session in which Haritha entertained lots of questions from the audience.
