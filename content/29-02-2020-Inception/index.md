IEEE SB GCEK conducted an Inter College competition “INCEPTION” as a part of AVEGA ’20 Robofest. It gave young entrepreneurs and innovators a platform to pitch their business ideas in front of a panel of judges from a business and investment community.
The event was held at EC Seminar Hall from 1:30 pm and lasted till 4 pm. About 9 teams presented their ideas which will bring about a change in our society in the near future.
The active participation of the participants along with the volunteers added colour to the event. The first prize worth 6K was bagged by Sajan Lawrence and team from Christ College of Engineering and the second prize worth 3K was bagged by Adithyan K S and team from Christ College of Engineering.
