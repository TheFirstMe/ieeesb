Just a Minute (JAM) is a one minute speech competition which was held on the behalf of IAS Chapter, IEEE SB GCEK. The competition was open to all. Considering the present scenario, JAM focused on bringing out the ideas of students on the topic ‘Role of technology during corona days’ in which the participants talked about the impacts that technology could create and at what extent it is used now. They shared the ideas they have in their head as well. Out of 14 participants, Prajul G’s (S4 ECE, GCEK) entry walked off with the first prize and Sneha Kadangot (S6 CSE, GCEK) bagged the second prize. It was indeed a great event!
