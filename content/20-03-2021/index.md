An online spectrum talk on the topic “Surveillance Cash” was conducted on the 20th of March 2021. The talk was given by Mrinal M of S8 CSE at 7 pm on the Google Meet platform. About 33 members of our SB participated.
Unlike the anarchic and highly sought-after Bitcoin, whose creation marked the genesis of digital cash DCEP gives up all its secrets. The People’s Bank records every DCEP transaction of any size across the entire Chinese economy, enabling a form of economic surveillance that was impossible to conceive of before the advent of digital cash but is now baked into the design of this new kind of money. Mrinal said that China may have been first, but nearly every other major national economy has its central bankers researching their own forms of digital cash. That makes this an excellent moment to consider the tensions at the intersection of money, technology, and society.
The talk ended with a Q&A session in which Mrinal entertained lots of questions from the audience.
